- Details about the last modification:
// 2023-03-20 ** MV ** (Upgrade GMACS to version 2.01.M) - 1. Add the developed code by ** AEP ** to read in environmental data and modify his
// version of the code to make it working with all stocks (bug in the loop while counting the
// number of selectivity parameters).
// - 2. Add the developped code by ** AEP ** to incorporate potential random walk in the selectivity parameters. Modify the initial code to
// make it more flexible. Need to be updated to allow environmental impacts not being dependent upon time period of random walk.
